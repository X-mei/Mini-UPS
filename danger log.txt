1、Suppose there are many requests from Amazon at the same time. If UPS finds the same idle
     truck, the database possibly have concurrency issues.
2、If the user is a user of Amazon but not a user of UPS, and if he buys something at Amazon, then
     he cannot log in to UPS, so he cannot see his all packages on packages. He can only see his
     packages by tracking numbers, because tracking a package does not require him to login.
3、We cannot deal with many requests. If the number of requests is super big, there probably be
      overflow issues.
4、If the flakness is high, the communication between Amazon and UPS may have problems.
5、 We still have some useless web pages.
6、If we do not successfully send the commands to the world due to the connection close, the
     current shipment will be stuck at the current status.
